## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **Microphone Not Working**
**Symptoms**: Sara doesn't respond to voice commands, no audio input detected

**Solutions**:
- Check Windows microphone permissions:
  - Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone → Enable access
- Verify microphone is set as default:
  - Control Panel → Sound → Recording → Set as Default
- Test microphone:
  - Right-click microphone → Properties → Listen → "Listen to this device"
- Update audio drivers:
  - Device Manager → Audio inputs and outputs → Update driver

#### 2. **Voice Recognition Not Responding**
**Symptoms**: Microphone works but commands not recognized

**Solutions**:
- **Speak clearly** and at **moderate pace** (not too fast/slow)
- **Reduce background noise** (close windows, turn off fans)
- **Adjust confidence threshold** in `main.cs` (line ~155):
  ```csharp
  if (confidence < 0.6f) // Try 0.4f for better sensitivity
  ```
- **Train Windows Speech Recognition**:
  - Settings → Time & Language → Speech → Get started
- **Check pronunciation**: Say "Hey Sara" clearly with emphasis
- **Re-position microphone** closer to mouth (6-12 inches)

#### 3. **Applications Not Opening**
**Symptoms**: Commands recognized but apps don't launch

**Solutions**:
- **Verify apps are installed** and accessible via Windows Search
- **Test Windows Search manually**: Win key → type app name
- **Run as Administrator**: Right-click → "Run as administrator"
- **Check app installation paths** in `OpenApp.cs`
- **Disable antivirus temporarily** (may block key simulation)
- **Update Windows Search indexing**:
  - Settings → Search → Searching Windows

#### 4. **Build Errors**
**Symptoms**: Project fails to compile or run

**Solutions**:
- **Verify .NET 6.0 installation**:
  ```bash
  dotnet --list-sdks
  # Should show 6.0.xxx
  ```
- **Restore NuGet packages**:
  ```bash
  dotnet restore --force
  dotnet clean
  dotnet build
  ```
- **Check all references**:
  - Ensure `System.Speech` is available
  - Install missing packages:
    ```bash
    dotnet add package System.Speech
    dotnet add package NAudio
    ```
- **Clear NuGet cache**:
  ```bash
  dotnet nuget locals all --clear
  ```

#### 5. **High CPU Usage**
**Symptoms**: System slow, high resource consumption

**Solutions**:
- **Close unnecessary programs** before running Sara
- **Lower speech recognition frequency** (modify polling intervals)
- **Disable debug logging** in release builds
- **Use Performance Mode**: Windows Settings → System → Power

#### 6. **Antivirus Blocking**
**Symptoms**: App blocked, key simulation flagged as malicious

**Solutions**:
- **Add exception in antivirus** for project folder
- **Temporarily disable real-time protection** during development
- **Use Windows Defender exclusions**:
  - Settings → Windows Security → Virus & threat protection → Exclusions

#### 7. **LM Studio Connection Issues**
**Symptoms**: AI features not working, "cannot connect to local AI" messages

**Solutions**:
- **Verify LM Studio is running**:
  - Open LM Studio application
  - Check "Local Server" tab shows "Server Running"
  - Confirm URL is `http://localhost:1234`
- **Check firewall settings**:
  - Allow LM Studio through Windows Firewall
  - Temporarily disable firewall to test
- **Test connection manually**:
  - Open browser and visit `http://localhost:1234/v1/models`
  - Should show available models in JSON format
- **Model loading issues**:
  - Ensure model is properly loaded in LM Studio
  - Try switching to a different model
  - Check available system memory
- **Port conflicts**:
  - Ensure no other application is using port 1234
  - Change LM Studio port if needed and update Sara AI configuration

### 🆘 Emergency Fixes

#### If Sara Won't Stop Listening:
- **Press 'Q'** in console window
- **Ctrl+C** to force quit
- **Task Manager** → End SaraAI process
- **Alt+F4** to close application window

#### If System Commands Go Wrong:

### LM Studio Setup Steps

#### 1. Install LM Studio
```bash
# Download from official website and install
# Or use package manager (if available)
winget install lmstudio
```

#### 2. Download a Model
- Open LM Studio
- Go to "Discover" tab
- Search for recommended models:
  - **Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct** (lightweight, good for most tasks)
  - **Mistral-7B-Instruct** (balanced performance)
  - **CodeLlama-7B** (specialized for code generation)
- Download your preferred model

#### 3. Start Local Server
- Switch to "Local Server" tab in LM Studio
- Load your downloaded model
- Click "Start Server"

✅ LM Studio connection successful!
📋 Available models: 1
   - your-model-name
```

### AI Voice Commands
Once LM Studio is running, you can use these enhanced commands:
