## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting Mode Issues**

### **Standalone Mode Problems**

#### **Voice Recognition Not Working**
```bash
# Check microphone permissions
# Windows Settings → Privacy → Microphone → Enable

# Test voice recognition
# Settings → Time & Language → Speech → Get started
```

#### **Commands Not Executing**
```bash
# Run as Administrator
# Right-click run.bat → "Run as administrator"

# Check Windows Search indexing
# Settings → Search → Searching Windows
```

### **Enhanced AI Mode Problems**

#### **"Cannot connect to local AI"**
```bash
# Verify LM Studio is running
curl http://localhost:1234/v1/models

# Check firewall settings
# Allow LM Studio through Windows Firewall

# Verify model is loaded
# LM Studio → Local Server → Model should be listed
```

#### **AI Responses Very Slow**
```bash
# Try smaller model (3B instead of 7B)
# Close other applications
# Check available RAM
# Consider GPU acceleration in LM Studio
```

#### **Connection Drops**
```bash
# Check power settings
# Prevent computer from sleeping
# Ensure stable network interface
```

## 🎨 **Customization Options**

### **Both Modes**
```csharp
// Adjust voice confidence threshold
if (confidence < 0.6f) // Try 0.4f for better sensitivity

// Modify wake words
var wakeWordChoices = new Choices("Hey Sara", "Sara", "Hello Sara");

// Add custom commands
commandChoices.Add("my custom command", "alternative phrase");
```

### **Enhanced AI Mode Only**
```csharp
// Customize AI personality
lmStudioModule.SetSystemPrompt("You are a helpful assistant specialized in...");

// Adjust AI parameters
var chatRequest = new ChatCompletionRequest
{
    temperature = 0.7,  // Creativity (0.1-1.0)
    max_tokens = 500    // Response length
};
```
