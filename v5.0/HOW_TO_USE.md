# ü§ñ SaraAI 5.0 - How to Use Guide

Welcome to SaraAI 5.0, your offline AI assistant! This guide will help you get started and make the most of your AI companion.

## üöÄ Running SaraAI 5.0

This section provides detailed instructions on how to set up and run SaraAI 5.0 on your system.

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

*   **Python**: Version 3.9 or higher.
*   **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher.
*   **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 11 or higher.
*   **C# .NET SDK**: Version 6.0 or higher.
*   **Rust**: Version 1.70 or higher.
*   **C++ Compiler**: Such as MSVC (on Windows) or GCC (on Linux/macOS).
*   **CMake**: Version 3.16 or higher.
*   **Git**: For cloning the repository.

You can check your installed versions using commands like:
```bash
python --version
node --version
java --version
dotnet --version
rustc --version
cmake --version
git --version
```

### 2. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the SaraAI repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd saraai-5.0
```
*(Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository)*

### 3. Install Dependencies and Build Modules

SaraAI is a multi-module project. You need to install dependencies and build each module.

**For Windows users:**
Run the setup and build script:
```powershell
# Navigate to the project directory if you haven't already
# cd path/to/saraai-5.0

# Run the setup script (installs dependencies for all modules)
.\scripts\setup.ps1

# Build all modules
.\scripts\build.ps1
```

**For Linux/macOS users:**
Run the setup and build script:
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory if you haven't already
# cd path/to/saraai-5.0

# Run the setup script (installs dependencies for all modules)
./scripts/setup.sh

# Build all modules
./scripts/build.sh
```
*Note: The build process might take some time as it compiles code from multiple languages.*

### 4. Start SaraAI

Once the build is complete, you can start the SaraAI assistant. The `.\run.ps1` (Windows) or `./run.sh` (Linux/macOS) script will start all necessary modules.

**Recommended way to start:**
```powershell
# Windows
.\run.ps1

# Linux/macOS
./run.sh
```

Alternatively, you can start the core orchestrator manually, which will then attempt to communicate with other running modules:
```bash
# Navigate to the core-python directory
cd core-python

# Activate Python virtual environment (if you created one during setup)
# Windows: .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# Linux/macOS: source venv/bin/activate

# Run the main orchestrator script
python main.py
```

### 5. Verify Installation and Access Dashboard

After starting SaraAI, you should see startup messages in your terminal indicating that modules are initializing and connecting.

**Verification Steps:**
1.  **Check Terminal Output**: Look for messages confirming that all modules have started successfully (e.g., `‚úÖ All modules started successfully`).
2.  **Open the Dashboard**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the SaraAI dashboard interface.
3.  **Wake Word Activation**: Listen for SaraAI to indicate that wake word detection is active. You can then try saying a wake word like "Hey Sara" followed by a command.

### Customizing Wake Word Settings

You can adjust wake word behavior using environment variables before starting SaraAI:

```bash
# Example for Windows PowerShell:
$env:SARAIA_WAKE_WORD_SENSITIVITY=0.8
$env:SARAIA_WAKE_WORD_ENABLED=true
python core-python/main.py

# Example for Linux/macOS:
export SARAIA_WAKE_WORD_SENSITIVITY=0.8
export SARAIA_WAKE_WORD_ENABLED=true
python core-python/main.py
```

## üéôÔ∏è Using Voice Commands

### Wake Words
SaraAI uses wake words to know when you want to talk to it. Say one of these to get its attention:

- **"Sara"**
- **"Hey Sara"**  
- **"Computer"**
- **"Assistant"**

### How Voice Interaction Works

1. **Say a Wake Word**: "Hey Sara"
2. **Wait for Response**: SaraAI will say "Yes?" to confirm it's listening
3. **Give Your Command**: Speak your request clearly
4. **Get Your Answer**: SaraAI will respond and perform the action

### Example Conversation
```
You: "Hey Sara"
SaraAI: "Yes?"
You: "What time is it?"
SaraAI: "The current time is 3:30 PM."
You: "Tell me a joke."
SaraAI: "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"
You: "Search for the latest advancements in AI."
SaraAI: "Searching for the latest advancements in AI. I found several articles. Would you like me to summarize them?"
You: "Yes, please."
SaraAI: "Okay, summarizing the top results..."
You: "Open Google Chrome."
SaraAI: "Opening Google Chrome."
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Wake Words Not Working

**Problem**: SaraAI doesn't respond to wake words

**Solutions**:
1. Check your microphone is working and not muted
2. Try speaking more clearly or closer to the microphone
3. Verify wake word detection is enabled in startup messages
4. Check if the speech module is running (should show ‚úÖ in startup)

### No Audio Response

**Problem**: SaraAI understands commands but doesn't speak back

**Solutions**:
1. Check your speakers/headphones are working
2. Verify the TTS (Text-to-Speech) module started successfully
3. Check Windows audio output settings
4. Try a volume control command: "Hey Sara, volume up"

### Dashboard Not Loading

**Problem**: Can't access the dashboard at localhost:3000

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the dashboard module started (look for ‚úÖ Dashboard in startup)
2. Check if port 3000 is being used by another application
3. Try refreshing the page or clearing browser cache
4. Make sure your firewall isn't blocking the connection

### Commands Not Understood

**Problem**: SaraAI says "I'm not sure how to help with that"

**Solutions**:
1. Try rephrasing your command using the examples above
2. Speak more clearly and avoid background noise
3. Use simpler, more direct commands
4. Say "Help" to hear what SaraAI can do

### Module Connection Issues

**Problem**: Error messages about modules not responding

**Solutions**:
1. Run the build script again: `.\scripts\build.ps1`
2. Check that all required tools are installed (Python, Java, .NET, etc.)
3. Restart SaraAI completely
4. Check Windows Defender or antivirus isn't blocking the executables

## üé≠ Tips for Best Experience

### Speaking to SaraAI
- **Speak clearly** and at normal pace
- **Use simple commands** rather than complex sentences
- **Wait for the "Yes?" response** before giving your command
- **Avoid background noise** when possible

### Wake Word Tips
- **Say wake words distinctly** - "Hey Sara" works better than "HeyySara"
- **Don't rush** - pause briefly after the wake word
- **Try different wake words** if one isn't working well for you

### Command Tips
- **Be specific**: "Open calculator" vs "Open something"
- **Use natural language**: "What time is it?" vs "Time query execute"
- **Try synonyms**: "Launch browser" or "Start browser" or "Open browser"

## üìö Advanced Usage
