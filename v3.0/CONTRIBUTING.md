## 📝 Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) guidelines
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Formatting
```bash
# Format code with Black
black .

# Check style with Flake8
flake8 .

# Type checking with MyPy
mypy .
```

### Documentation
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include type hints where possible
- Comment complex logic

### Example Function
```python
def process_voice_command(command: str, timeout: int = 5) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Process a voice command and return the result.
    
    Args:
        command: The voice command to process
        timeout: Maximum time to wait for processing
        
    Returns:
        Processed command result or None if failed
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If command is empty or invalid
    """
    if not command.strip():
        raise ValueError("Command cannot be empty")
    
    # Process command logic here
    return processed_result
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure
- Place tests in `tests/` directory
- Mirror the source code structure
- Use descriptive test names

### Writing Tests
```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from main import SaraAI

def test_sara_ai_initialization():
    """Test Sara AI initializes correctly in text mode."""
    sara = SaraAI(text_mode=True)
    assert sara.ai_engine is not None
    assert sara.app_launcher is not None

def test_command_processing():
    """Test command processing with mock input."""
    sara = SaraAI(text_mode=True)
    intent, entities = sara.ai_engine.understand_command("open notepad")
    assert intent == "open_app"
    assert entities.get("app_name") == "notepad"
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_main.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=.
```
